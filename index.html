    <h2>About Flow</h2>
    <p>Flow is a simple yet powerful focus timer designed to help you stay productive and enter the <strong>flow state</strong> effortlessly. Inspired by the Pomodoro Technique but without rigid time constraints, Flow lets you work for as long as you need—whether it's <strong>30 minutes, an hour, or more</strong>—so you can stay fully immersed in your tasks.</p>
    
    <h2>Why Flow?</h2>
