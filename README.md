## About Flow

Flow is a simple yet powerful focus timer designed to help you stay productive and enter the **flow state** effortlessly. Inspired by the Pomodoro Technique but without rigid time constraints, Flow lets you work for as long as you need—whether it's **30 minutes, an hour, or more**—so you can stay fully immersed in your tasks.

### Why Flow?
- **No Time Limits** – Unlike traditional Pomodoro timers, Flow **doesn’t force breaks** every 25 minutes. You decide how long you want to work.
- **Stay Focused** – Track your sessions and keep distractions away.
- **Boost Productivity** – Work in deep focus mode and improve efficiency.

Whether you're studying, working, or creating, Flow helps you structure your time while allowing flexibility to keep you in **the zone**.
